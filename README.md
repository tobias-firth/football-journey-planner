## User Story

* A football fan ‘Mario’ wants to be able to quickly look up the football match schedule of his favourite English premier league team.
* Once Mario types this information in, the web page should display the upcoming matches for the season, and where those matches are being played.
* The web page will save this information for future reference.
* After it displays the schedule, next to each match should be a button to “See Journey” - when the user clicks this button it displays the         recommended journey to take to get from his hometown to the location of the match.

## Motivation for creation

Football has, for over a century, acted as a method of bringing people together and a device for being a part of celebrating who you are and where you come from (unless you're a Manchester United fan, because it can be certain you're not from Manchester). Every weekend, thousands of passionate fans travel far and wide across the country to support their team, as many have done in the generations before them, setting off early and arriving home late and taking a vast array of planes, trains and automobiles to be there to watch their team. Football has introduced people to people they had never met and places they would have never dreamed of going to, such as Rotherham, but all of this comes at a cost. A logistical nightmare. In 2007, Leeds fans arrived at a game wearing "Where's Yeovil?" t-shirts, with a map and an arrow on pointing vaguely in the direciton of Somerset. Clearly, high levels of dedication amongst fans are hiding a low level of domestic geography knoweledge and navigation skills. A solution is required. Enter the football journey planner, a webpage allowing fans to plan a journey to an upcoming fixture with just the click of a button.

## Process: What were the technologies used? How were tasks and roles broken down and assigned? What challenges did you encounter? What were your successes?

* In order to complete the project, we used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, JQuery and Ajax. We used the Google Maps API and the api-football API. 
* Adam and Tobias worked on the backend, with Tobias mainly focusing on the football API and Adam on the Google Maps API. Finding a suitable API was a challenge as an earlier iteration of the project used a different Journey Planning API which had a tighter limit on calls, making it less suitable for testing. 
* Ian, Jalil and Petru worked on the frontend, with  
Ian mainly focusing on the struture of HTML and the grid of CSS.
